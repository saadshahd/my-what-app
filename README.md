#### Use NPM scripts

- `npm run build` to build an optimized version of your application in /dist
- `npm run serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
- `npm run serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
- `npm run test` to launch your unit tests with Karma
- `npm run test:auto` to launch your unit tests with Karma in watch mode


#### Or Gulp tasks

If you have [`gulp-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) installed in global packages you can use equivalent:

- `gulp` or `gulp build`
- `gulp serve`
- `gulp serve:dist`
- `gulp test`
- `gulp test:auto`

**If you don't have [`gulp-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) installed in global, you would face this error:**
> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js:121
    gulpInst.start.apply(gulpInst, toRun);
TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined
